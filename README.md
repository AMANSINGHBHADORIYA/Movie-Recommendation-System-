# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using advanced techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. The recommendation system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences, historical interactions, and similarities with other users or movies.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Gathered movie-related data including attributes like cast, director, genre, user interactions such as ratings, and contextual information such as release year and popularity.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and noise. Extracted relevant features and created a unified representation of movies and users.
- **Model Development:** Utilized advanced recommendation techniques to generate personalized movie recommendations for users.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed the performance of the recommendation system using evaluation metrics tailored to recommendation systems, including precision at K, recall at K, mean average precision, and user-based evaluations like A/B testing or user studies.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Fine-tuned the recommendation system based on evaluation results and user feedback to enhance its accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision at K (P@K):** Measures the proportion of relevant items in the top-K recommended list.
- **Recall at K (R@K):** Measures the proportion of relevant items retrieved in the top-K recommended list out of all relevant items.
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** Computes the average precision across all users, considering both relevance and ranking of recommendations.
- **User-Based Evaluations:** Conducted A/B testing experiments or user studies to gather feedback on user satisfaction, engagement, and preferences regarding the recommendation system's performance.

## Conclusion
The movie recommendation system project aims to leverage advanced techniques and evaluation metrics to develop an effective and personalized recommendation system for movie enthusiasts. By evaluating the system's performance using appropriate metrics and methodologies, we ensure its accuracy, relevance, and practical utility in providing tailored movie recommendations to users, thereby enhancing their overall viewing experience and satisfaction.
